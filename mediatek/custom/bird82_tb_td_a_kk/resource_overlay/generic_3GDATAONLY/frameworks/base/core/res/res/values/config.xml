    <!-- Flag indicating whether the current device is "voice capable".
         If true, this means that the device supports circuit-switched
         (i.e. voice) phone calls over the telephony network, and is
         allowed to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is
         active.  This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't make voice calls and don't support any in-call UI.

         Note: this flag is subtly different from the
         PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY system feature, which is
         available on *any* device with a telephony radio, even if the
         device is data-only. -->

    <!-- Flag indicating whether the current device allows sms service.
         If true, this means that the device supports both sending and
         receiving sms via the telephony network.
         This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't send and receive sms message.

         Note: Disable SMS also disable voicemail waiting sms,
               cell broadcasting sms, and MMS. -->
